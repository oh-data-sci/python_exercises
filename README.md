# introduction
this repo contains a draft of easy python exercises. the user is assumed to have basic familiarity with python. the exercises present a handful some useful features of python to inepxerienced users. this is not a course in python for newcomers to programming but rather a tool for improving beginning users of python to do basic tasks. some of the exercises are original and some are collected from online resources.

# prerequisites
## shell
we will be working in the unix command line, acessed e.g. via `terminal.app` or `iterm2.app` on a mac computer. there are some basic commands that participants will be expected to know: 

    `ls`,`cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `echo`, `wc`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `less`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`

we assume participants have python 3.7 installed and ready to use (code examples will not be backwards-compatible with python 2.x.), as well as their favourite text editor or IDE, and browser for jupyter notebook. 

you can check your current `python` version by opening up a shell (e.g. `terminal.app`/`iterm.app` on a mac) and entering `python --version`. 

we assume the participants can use git. this workshop does not cover how to. for a refresher on git, participants could look into pages 13 through 18 of [this document](http://columbia-applied-data-science.github.io/appdatasci.pdf).

participants should have familiarity with the [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) style guide, so that we can all (attempt to) follow it together. (caveat that "a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds")

## jupyter notebooks
participants can decide whether they edit their code in an ide or a text editor and run from the shell, or whether they prefer to work in a jupyter notebook, but the exercises will be presented in the form of notebooks.

- installation instructions
- launching
- using (modes, keyboard shortcuts, starting and stopping executions, error handling)

# solutions
participants in the tutorial can add their solutions/musings/code into a self-named sub-folder of the `solutions` folder.

# notes
a list of documentation and links to helpful sources explaining features discussed in greater detail.

# warning
there is no sage on this stage. merely a guide to the side.
