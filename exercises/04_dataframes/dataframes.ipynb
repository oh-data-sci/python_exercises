    "# introducing dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "a dataframe is best described as a table with particular properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- there is one row per observation (what defines an observation may vary case by case).\n",
    "- there is one column per measure.\n",
    "- all values of each column (i.e. all rows) must be the same data type.\n",
    "- the columns may be (most often are) of different data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "together these properties define \"tidy data\". tidy data is the preferred format to work with when it comes to modeling and analysis. many useful modules and functions assume the input to be in tidy format and also shape their output to be tidy. this offers the ability to string these functions together to make complex manipulations. again, the `pandas` module makes working with dataframes easier so we will be using that.\n",

    "# manipulating dataframes\n",

    "today we will see how we can manipulate dataframes with pandas to \n",
    "- trim, \n",
    "- filter, \n",
    "- summarise, \n",

    "pandas dataframes. (later we will look into joining dataframes, but we won't have time for it now).\n",

    "# today's exercise:\n",
    "use what you have learned in your previous solutions to read in the new york rodent inspection data as a `pandas` dataframe, and then augment that dataframe with wait time (interval between inspection and approval), weekday,  and iso-week of inspection. also add a new column, `season` of the inspection date (defined as: dec-feb, inclusive, is winter, mar-may is spring, jun-aug is summer, sep-nov is fall). \n",
    "\n",
    "then answer the following questions: \n",
    "- between the dates of 2010-01-01 and 2010-03-31, what was the daily average number of inspections?\n",
    "- between the dates of 2010-01-01 and 2010-03-31, which weekday had the greatest number of inspections?\n",
    "- between the dates of 2010-01-01 and 2010-03-31, which weekday had the least number of inspections?\n",
    "\n",
    "if you are confident that you can already solve this, the rest of the session is not much use to you. \n",
    "\n",
    "as a bonus we should be able to answer these further questions\n",
    "- which weekday has the longest average wait time for approval in the winter? (let's define the seasons as: (dec-feb is winter, mar-may is spring, jun-aug is summer, sep-nov is fall).\n",
    "- which weekday has the longest average wait time for approval in the summer?\n",
    "- which season has the greatest number of inspections? \n",
    "- which season has the greatest number of distinct dates ...\n",
    "    + a) in the data set\n",
    "    + b) in the calendar? \n",
    "- which borough has the greatest difference in the number of inspections in the spring vs in the fall?\n",
    "- count the number of inspections per [iso-week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date). find the week with the greatest number of inspections. for that week, and that week only, count the inspections by day-of-week."
