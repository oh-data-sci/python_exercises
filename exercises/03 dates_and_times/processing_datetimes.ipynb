    "we frequently work with dates and timestamps, and it often gets tricky. there are countless issues that can crop up due to differing time formats, calendars, time zones. the every day definitions of the various time measures we use hide obscure complexity. thus, time intervals and date arithmetics are not trivial to compute from first principles. consider for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- years differ in length, a year is not even an integer number of days long. \n",
    "- a calendar year is not an even number of weeks.\n",
    "- the months, and the (financial) quarters in a year are not all equally long. and not an integer multiple of weeks.\n",
    "- fiscal years differ from calendar years (and are location specific!)\n",
    "- we might plausibly need to count events during a time period in number of working days (excluding weekends and holidays from the count). \n",
    "- given a datestamp, how you can find out what week number does that time stamp take place in? to calculate this from first principles we'd need to to know \n",
    "    + what weekday is the first day of the week? (convention varies by location and industry, typically either  sunday or monday)\n",
    "    + was it in a leap year? february's extra day shifts the weekdays rythm.\n",
    "    + what timezone was the timestamp recorded and in which timezone are we counting the weeks? (imagine we are aggregating by week as observed in UTC and the time stamp above was recorded in china standard time, many hours ahead. then the timestamp might actually belong to the \"next week\".)\n",
    "- what date is 01/02/03? or 08/09/06 (this is a maddeningly common date format.)\n",
    "- DO NOT get me started on daylight savings time... \n",
    "\n",
    "there are two aspects at play here. the first is date and time formating , and the second is date and time arithmetic. the latter is impossible without the former.\n",
    "\n",
    "luckily python has modules that help us deal with these formats and calculations. we just need to learn to use them. here we will demonstrate the use of the `datetime` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a suggestion:\n",
    "i suggest that whenever and whereever you need to display a date, no matter what the context is, use the [iso format designed to minimize misunderstanding and confusion](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html): *YYYY-MM-DD*. \n",
    "\n",
    "this is the internationally recognized standard date format (and therefore the best format, bar none) whose adoption will reduce confusion and errors. use it. design dates fields in forms this way. date your notes this way. set your computer's localisation format to this. expect dates in this format by default. python will assume dates are in this format by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### extra credit:\n",
    "shame those who won't use this format, for their only defense is bigotry which favours their own familiarity over universal clarity and which hides a callous indifference to the manifold unforeseeable errors caused by date confusion."
