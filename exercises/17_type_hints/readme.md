2019-09-23 type hinting in python
===

# introduction
this workshop session introduced type hinting/annotations for python code. we learned that type hints/annotations are not required, do not speed up code, and do not prevent code from running. however, they make code more legible, reveal possible hidden errors before runtime, make code refactoring easier and are generally a nicer way to write maintainable code.
